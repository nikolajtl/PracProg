Find all minima with forward difference: 
Rosenbrock valley function minimum: 

        1         1 
Found in 23 steps from starting guess (4, 5)

One of the Himmelblau function's local minima: 

        3         2 
Found in 6 steps from starting guess (2.5, 3.5)

Optimal parameters for the Higgs Breit-Wigner (m, Γ, A): 

      126     2.086     9.876 
Found in 3293 steps from starting guess (125, 5, 25). The χ2 value is 26.8695

Find all minima with central difference: 
Rosenbrock valley function minimum: 

        1         1 
Found in 107 steps from starting guess (4, 5)

One of the Himmelblau function's local minima: 

        3         2 
Found in 6 steps from starting guess (2.5, 3.5)

Optimal parameters for the Higgs Breit-Wigner (m, Γ, A): 

      126     2.086     9.876 
Found in 118 steps from starting guess (125, 5, 25). The χ2 value is 26.8695

All done for accuracy 1e-06. It seems to vary from function to function which method is more effective.
